<p>Hi, I’m Moecopilot. I’m committed to designing highly modular, integrated, universal, technically and commercially viable product solutions. I pursue flattening, design sense, to provide customers with the best user experience. I enjoy is put forward and the problem solving process and the sense of achievement, to hone their skills to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>In this document, I will show you my professional skills, design concepts, individual and team project capabilities and learning potential, which are divided into three parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the learning experience with the priority of time-line breadth, focusing on development, trends and processes.</li>
<li>Introduce individual projects in depth, focusing on my thinking, design concepts and technical capabilities.</li>
<li>Personal potential analysis and summary.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Timeline"><a href="#Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Timeline"></a>Timeline</h2><h3 id="Start-programming"><a href="#Start-programming" class="headerlink" title="Start programming"></a>Start programming</h3><p>As a result of my interest, I came into contact with the knowledge of programming in the fifth grade of primary school and dreamed of becoming a hacker. I know what that means, and I know that the so-called hackers who are so active in chat software are mostly scripts and bragging people. I decided to go step by step and start to learn C language and web by myself.</p>
<p>In the first grade of junior high school, although I had the requirement of game plug-in and computing tools, I suffered from the lack of the ability to build projects and C language GUI. For the first time, I felt the gap between theoretical technology and practical needs, and gradually developed this pragmatic Self-learning Model and learning concept.</p>
<p>Until I graduated from junior high school, I persisted in training my ability to solve problems and constantly put forward needs, using all means to solve it. During this period, I met many excellent friends and teachers, and found that there is no universal global optimal algorithm or the simplest programming tool. No matter what kind of programming language and tools have their own fields and functions. I take the initiative to understand a wide range of tools and algorithms. Although I may not understand him very well, it has become a habit for me to quickly analyze the language and algorithms that are applicable when I propose requirements.</p>
<h3 id="Focus-on-Design"><a href="#Focus-on-Design" class="headerlink" title="Focus on Design"></a>Focus on Design</h3><p>In my first year of high school, I came into contact with the information contest NOIP, and studied the algorithm for about a year. Although I got some results, I only confirmed my interest in design more. So I quit the contest and concentrate on design.</p>
<p>When I was a sophomore in high school, I started B-Tree Design Studio on my own and began to take over the graduation projects of some college students. At this time, I found that I had some ability to build small and medium-sized projects, so I became more firm in the current pragmatism of self-learning, and began to have the idea of building commercial products to make money on their own.</p>
<p>I started putting forward my own needs, learning, making, iterating, refactoring… Natural design sense and perfectionism make me not only have high requirements in functional technology, but also want to achieve global optimum in appearance, practicability, compatibility, coupling, integration and so on. This period is my period of rapid development. I didn’t know anything about circuitry a few months ago, but I learned and applied dozens of MCUs and hundreds of IC in a few months. PCB design is also more and more skilled.</p>
<p>Poverty makes people progress. I have put a lot of effort into single-chip computer, IC selection and design cost optimization. I hope to achieve the best results with the minimum resource and time cost, and have achieved good results (now at least have enough money to eat).</p>
<h3 id="Teamwork"><a href="#Teamwork" class="headerlink" title="Teamwork"></a>Teamwork</h3><p>On the recommendation of my classmates, I sent my resume to DJI Robomaster Middle School Winter Camp. I got a place in the embedded direction and met more like-minded and amazing guys. Although we didn’t have enough experience, which led to a mistake in the timing of the project and a loss of the game, it didn’t prevent me from learning a lot from these great guys.</p>
<p>I don’t know when to start. Every day I feel that I don’t have enough time. I plan to learn network security and participate in the CTF contest, learn AI, chaotic mathematics, orchestration, erhu. Also because the college entrance examination needs to suspend the study of painting, FPGA design, industrial and artistic modeling and so on, I will continue to learn.</p>
<p>This is my learning and project process from a time perspective. In the following, I choose some projects that can represent my design thinking and ability and present them to you.</p>
<p>Since I have not retained the original design, and the number of iterations is too large to list all, I will only list some key issues and important iterations, please understand.</p>
<h2 id="Project"><a href="#Project" class="headerlink" title="Project"></a>Project</h2><h3 id="AR-Glasses"><a href="#AR-Glasses" class="headerlink" title="AR Glasses"></a>AR Glasses</h3><ul>
<li><p>Purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is convenient to display some data that must be monitored all the time or the detector data that needs to be held by both hands.</li>
<li><p>Visualization of information reminders.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can float the multimeter data directly to the front and process it, making it safer.<br>When you pid the parameter, you can directly read the data and draw it, and slide the finger to change the parameters.<br>When it is connected to the phone, it collects the phone prompts and analyzes the display.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements: Floating screens in front of you, with information prompts, data acquisition and display, touch, photo, Bluetooth and other functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overall implementation: If you make the screen or projector image at a distance from the Fresnel lens equal to the focal length, it will allow parallel light to enter the eye, and the brain will have an infinite virtual image on the back path. The transflective lens takes over the display of the virtual image. I built the ble client on Android Studio and designed the motherboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Technical Difficulties:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The cost is difficult to optimize;  </li>
<li>ble notification transmission requires mobile phone cooperation;  </li>
<li>Monochrome oled is not good-looking, multi-color is expensive and the size is not the same;  </li>
<li>The Raspberry Pi is not real-time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Important iterations of the project and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Testing machine 0.1.0 alpha<br>¥ 200</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Found a low cost full color oled supplier and made compatible</li>
<li>More than 40 shell selections and iterations</li>
<li>Can display time and display prompts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>0.3.0 alpha (insufficient funds, not all completed)<br>¥ 130</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During this project, I handwritten hardware iic, spi transfer protocol, designed Bluetooth data protocol to prevent packet loss, learned industrial modeling, and assembled 3D printer. It was the beginning of my project experience, but it could only be temporarily stagnant due to technical and financial problems.</p>
<h3 id="Infinitely-dimmable-night-light"><a href="#Infinitely-dimmable-night-light" class="headerlink" title="Infinitely dimmable night light"></a>Infinitely dimmable night light</h3><ul>
<li>Purpose: Night light</li>

<li>All functions and design requirements are pushed into the above projects and integrated</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this project, I contacted various MCUs and ICs to compare and select models and design common interfaces. Even bought dozens of booster circuit chips. I originally wanted to design a universal switch module for this module. After the integration is getting higher and higher, in order to utilize the space resources and take into account the various outputs of the universal switch, I gradually put the entire night light circuit design into the output function.</p>
<h3 id="Full-color-breathing-light-touch-switch-module"><a href="#Full-color-breathing-light-touch-switch-module" class="headerlink" title="Full color breathing light touch switch module"></a>Full color breathing light touch switch module</h3><ul>
<li>Purpose:<ol>
<li>Originally I just wanted to design a universal touch switch for the night light module.</li>
<li>As the design integration becomes higher and higher, the target correction is “the switch that anyone can easily use it, with any output and breathing light”.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Requirements: The interface is comprehensive and convenient for connection and coupling, with many output functions, convenient interface debugging, high degree of personalization and customization, beautiful, low cost and simple mass production.</li>
<li>Technical Difficulties:  <ol>
<li>The integration degree is not up to the requirement, the size requirement is too high, and the design of the main board is difficult under the condition of material cost;  </li>
<li>The sensitivity and anti-interference of the TTP223 touch chip are not up to standard;  </li>
<li>The performance of the ms82f1402 is not up to standard, and the size of the ms83f is too large;  </li>
<li>The 5050 size ws2812 lamp bead timing bit is not clear, and the frame fragment is seriously lost;  </li>
<li>MC34063 booster chip current is not enough, the volume is too large, consider replacement;  </li>
<li>Algorithm problems;<br>Etc. …… too much to say.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Important iterations of the project and improvements:<br>  Since there are too many iterations and most of them have not been recorded, I will only introduce you to the latest alpha version:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>17.23.1 alpha<br>only ¥ 30</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Refactor all code, refactor the program run framework, remove redundancy</li>
<li>Remove the MC34063 chip and all its dependent circuits to SH1208 boost chip</li>
<li>Peripheral hardware control bits for mass production custom</li>
<li>Refactor EEPROM set definition to store more user settings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this project, I designed nanosecond timing to help ws2812 transmit data bits, time-division multiplexing to achieve 4 GPIOs to control the independent state of 12 independent bead, try frequency division multiplexing data transfer, squeeze this 0.2 RMB All the resources of the MCU, looking for manufacturers that meet the design requirements everywhere…</p>
<p>The above three are just some of my more representative projects, Besides, an extremely modular IoT detection component made up of WinnerMicro W600, a GUI template built with electron-vue, an esp8266 development board to build Wifi-killer and so on, are also perfect.</p>
<h3 id="Teamwork-ability-DJI-robomaster-winter-camp"><a href="#Teamwork-ability-DJI-robomaster-winter-camp" class="headerlink" title="Teamwork ability - DJI robomaster winter camp"></a>Teamwork ability - DJI robomaster winter camp</h3><p>At the beginning of 2019, I entered the robomaster winter camp in the embedded direction.<br>Although I have had a teamwork experience on github before, I was the first to participate in such a team project online.</p>
<p>we need to make two robots in less than ten days and fight against other teams.</p>
<p>During this time, I became more familiar with the use of the git repository that was only used as a project store. Following the captain, I learned the pid tuning. The google code style that I developed before was also used. Because of those great guy’s magical operation. I have benefited a lot.</p>
<h2 id="At-last"><a href="#At-last" class="headerlink" title="At last"></a>At last</h2><p>I think that the most important and correct decision I make is to do my best to learn what I like.</p>
<p>They said I was a fool. They said that the projects I spend those time to were useless.</p>
<p>But I would not regret it at all, even if I gave up my position and reputation in public education.</p>
<p>Because I love them.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>Stay hungry, stay foolish.</p>
<p>Never stop.</p>
